Datasets that can be used in the case studies
=============================================

[`gen_teca`](http://leg.ufpr.br/~walmes/pacotes/EACS-vignettes/gen_teca.html)
:  An experiment done with genotypes of teca. Four "size" variables were
measured. The multivariate analysis can be applied to reveal linear
combinations to better discriminate among genotypes. Univariate analysis
of variance can be done on the first canonical variate followed by multiple
comparisons of means.

[`teca_qui`](http://leg.ufpr.br/~walmes/pacotes/EACS-vignettes/teca_qui.html)
:  Several soil variables were measured for 50 soil samples at three
depths. Profile analysis can be done to understand how soil layer
influence or contribute to differences among variables. A soil index
can be constructed.

[`pineapple_swrc`](http://leg.ufpr.br/~walmes/pacotes/wzCoop-vignettes/pineapple_swrc.html)
:  The soil water retention curve parameters is studied in a 4-factorial
experiment. Repeated measures in the soil depth were taken. Which are
the most influenced responses and more strong effects?

[`coffee_pathogenicity`](http://leg.ufpr.br/~walmes/pacotes/nematistics-vignettes/coffee_pathogenicity.html)
:  Three production variables were measured to access the effect of
initial nematode soil density (*Meloidogyne*) in the development of
coffee plants under two root-stock.

[`ninfas`](https://github.com/leg-ufpr/MRDCr/blob/devel/R/ninfas.R)
:  The number nymphs of whitefly (count variables) were recorded in
three positions on the plant for 10 cultivars across time on the same
experimental units (longitudinal study). There is difference among
cultivars or interaction with plant position?
