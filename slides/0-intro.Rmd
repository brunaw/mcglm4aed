# Introduction and Outline

## What is this course about

  * Often in experimental studies many outcomes are collected
    simultaneously.
  * Sometimes the outcomes or response variables are of mixed types.
  * Methods for the separate analysis of such outcomes are well
    established in the literature.
    - Continuous and symmetric data: linear regression models.
    - Continuous and assymetric data: gamma and inverse Gaussian
      regression models.
    - Semi-continuous data: Tweedie and zero-inflated regression models.
    - Counting data: Poisson, negative binomial, Poisson-Tweedie
      and $\ldots$ regression models.
    - Bounded data: logistic, probit, beta, simplex
      and $\ldots$  regression models.

## Main goal

  * Purpose of this course is to present the state of art in
    **Multivariate analysis of experimental data based on the
      multivariate covariance generalized linear models class.**

## Learnings objectives

  * After this course participants will be able to
    - identify settings in which a multivariate analysis is required,
    - construct and fit an appropriate multivariate model, and
    - correctly interpret the obtained results.

  * The course will be explanatory rather than mathematically rigorous
    - emphasis is given on sufficient detail in order for participants
      to obtain a clear view on the multivariate models and how they
      should be used in practice.

## Outline

### Part I: Multivariate analysis of Gaussian data (MANOVA)

  * Motivational datasets and research questions.
  * The General Multivariate (Gaussian) Linear Model.
    - Estimation and inference (least squares and MLE).
    - General linear hypotheses.
    - Multivariate hypotheses tests.
    - Computational implementation in $\textsf{R}$.
    - Usage of the $\texttt{lm()}$ and $\texttt{manova()}$ functions.
    - MANOVA in the McGLM framework.
    - The $\texttt{mcglm()}$ function.
    - Worked examples.
    - Assumptions and limitations.
    - Concluding remarks.

### Part II: Multivariate analysis of non-Gaussian data (McGLM)

  * Dealing with non-independent data: Linear covariance models (LCMs).
  * Specifying the matrix linear predictor:
    - Repeated measures.
    - Longitudinal studies.
    - Mixed models.
  * Dealing with non-Gaussian data: Multivariate generalized linear
    models (MGLMs).
  * Estimation and Inference.
  * General linear hypotheses tests.
  * MANOVA-like test for non-Gaussian data.
  * Worked examples.
  * Discussions and extensions.
